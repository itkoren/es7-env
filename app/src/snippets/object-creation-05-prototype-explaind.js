/** TODO: Add Slide to understand the connection of the Prototype */
/* 

A new instance of an object is created and its prototype (exposed via the __proto__ property)
is set to the prototype property of the constructor function.

The problem here is that there are two different prototypes being discussed.
One is the 'real' prototype, the one that determines the type of an object,
the other is simply the prototype property of the constructor function.
These are two very different things that unfortunately share the same name.
